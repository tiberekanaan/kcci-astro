### AI Interaction Guidelines

#### Communication
*  Be concise and direct
*  Explain non-obvious decisions briefly
*  Ask before large refactors or architectural changes
*  Don't add features not in the project spec
*  Never delete files without clarification

#### Workflow
This is the common workflow that we will use for every single feature/fix:
1.  **Document** - Document the feature in `@context/current-feature.md`.
2.  **Branch** - Create new branch for feature, fix, etc.
3.  **Implement** - Implement the feature/fix that I create in `@context/current-feature.md`
4.  **Test** - Verify it works in the browser and connects properly to the Storyblok Visual Editor. Implement unit testing later. Run `npm run build` and fix any errors.
5.  **Iterate** - Iterate and change things if needed
6.  **Commit** - Only after build passes and everything works
7.  **Merge** - Merge to main
8.  **Delete Branch** - Delete branch after merge
9.  **Review** - Review AI-generated code periodically and on demand.
10. Mark as completed in `@context/current-feature.md` and add to history

Do NOT commit without permission and until the build passes. If build fails, fix the issues first.

#### Branching
We will create a new branch for every feature/fix. Name branch **feature/[feature]** or **fix[fix]**, etc. Ask to delete the branch once merged.

#### Commits
*  Ask before committing (don't auto-commit)
*  Use conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.)
*  Keep commits focused (one feature/fix per commit)
*  Never put "Generated With Claude" in the commit messages

#### Code Changes
*  Make minimal changes to accomplish the task
*  Don't refactor unrelated code unless asked
*  Preserve existing patterns in the codebase
